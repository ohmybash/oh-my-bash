# Add your own custom alias in the custom/aliases directory. Aliases placed
# here will override ones with the same name in the main alias directory.
#
# Usage:
#
# 1. use the exact naming schema like '<my_aliases>.aliases.sh' where the
#    filename needs to end with .aliases.sh (just <my_aliases>.sh does not
#    work)
# 2. add the leading part of that filename ('<my_aliases>' in this example) to
#    the 'aliases' array in your ~/.bashrc
