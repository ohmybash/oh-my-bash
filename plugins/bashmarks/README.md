# Bashmarks plugin

The Bashmarks plugin allows you to create and use bookmarks for directories on
your filesystems.  This plugin is derived from the project
https://github.com/huing/bashmarks but contains improvements.  This plugin is
licensed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

## Quickstart

Create a new bookmark using the *bm -a* command:

```bash
$ bm -a mydir
```

The command above creates a bookmark for the current directory with the name
*mydir*.

You can navigate to the location of a bookmark using the *bm -g* command:

```bash
$ bm -g mydir
```

You can also supply just any bookmark name and the *-g* option will be assumed:

```bash
$ bm mydir
```

Tab completion is available when you need to enter a bookmark name in a
command, such as when using *bm -g*

Easily list all bookmarks you have set up using the *bm -l* command:

```bash
$ bm -l
```

## Configuration
