This line might start to look like this its location is usually here: `.bashrc` `.bash_profile`.
```shell
plugins = (git bundler osx rake ruby)
```
_⚠️ if you want to only add the plugin(s) and not oh-my-bash you can copy it and paste it directly into .bashrc or .bash_profile. by doing this the plugins will not receive updates, the errors will have to be solved by you_
