# Unlimited history size. Doesn't appear to slow things down, so why not?
# Export these variables to apply them also to the child shell sessions.
#
# Note: There are multiple ways to realize the unlimited history size.
#
# 1) A documented way is HISTSIZE=-1.  However, this is only supported in bash
#   >= 4.3 and it causes clearing the user's history in bash < 4.3.  Even if
#   we use HISTSIZE=-1 only when the current Bash version is 4.3 or above, it
#   clears the user's history file when a lower version of Bash is in the
#   system and it is started without setting HISTSIZE (e.g. when the Bash is
#   started with --norc or the specified init file is broken).  One could
#   consider giving up making HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE environment variables,
#   but then it truncates the user's history file when a new Bash is started
#   without setting HISTSIZE.
#
# 2) Another well known trick is to set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to an empty
#   string.  This works as unlimited history in all the Bash versions.
#   However, an empty HISTSIZE environment variable causes a startup error in
#   Mksh.  One could consider giving up making HISTSIZE environment variable,
#   but again, this will truncate the user's history file with Bash without
#   configuration.  One might consider defining a shell function or an alias to
#   start mksh without the HISTSIZE environment variable, but the users
#   wouldn't like it.  In addition, the truncated history problem persists with
#   the child Bash started within persists.
#
# 3) We instead consider explicitly specifying to HISTSIZE a large number that
#   is unlikely to be reached.  A typical value might be 10000 or 100000, but
#   that can still be reached by heavy users.  We instead specify a number as
#   large as possible.  The number shall not exceed INT_MAX, or otherwise
#   HISTSIZE becomes negative and clears the user's history.  In case there is
#   a system where `int' is a 16-bit signed integer, we choose 0x7FFF7FFF so
#   that the lower word is 0x7FFF.  This still does not ensure that the 16-bit
#   integer becomes 0x7FFF after overflow (since the overflow of the signed
#   integer causes the undefined behavior in the C standard), but it is safer
#   in typical implementations.
#
# See discussion on https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/issues/586.
